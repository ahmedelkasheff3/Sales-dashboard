# Sales-dashboard
The goal was to analyze a multi-year dataset of global produce orders (2019–2020) to identify key revenue drivers, regional performance trends, and tax liabilities. The final output was a dynamic dashboard designed to provide stakeholders with at-a-glance insights into product category health and geographic sales distribution
